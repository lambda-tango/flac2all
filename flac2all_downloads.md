# Download flac2all #

Since google changed their terms, and prevented me from any further publishing of flac2all, I've set up an external download page:

<a href='http://flac2all.witheredfire.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi'>Flac2all Download page</a>

The old links should work for the foreseeable future (I won't pull them, but no idea if Google will). However all new versions will be on the external page.
